Hobbies: Going outdoors, watching movies, reading books, and playing video games.
I also love to hang out with my kitty and girlfriend whenever I can :).

Program Background:
Prior to coming to OSU I had little to no programming experience.
I now have done both cs 161/162 and my favorite project was the final project of 162.
